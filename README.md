# Visualizing the Spotify Soundscape

In this assignment, we build an interactive dashboard to explore the [Spotify Top 50 Tracks 2023](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yukawithdata/spotify-top-tracks-2023/), which lists the top 50 songs based on their popularity on Spotify.
We use D3.js and Plotly.js for loading the data and creating visualizations and we use HTML for designing the webpages.

# Instructions
1. The data is converted into json format for ease of loading and is present at [data/Spotify.json](https://github.com/KatameRonin/Visualizing-Top-Songs-on-Spotify/blob/main/data/Spotify.json)
2.  The index.html is the home/songs tab page. The visualizations for this page are generated by songs.js.
3.  The genres.html is the page for Genres tab. The visualizations for this page are generated by genres.js.
4.  The artist.html is the page for Artists tab. The visualizations for this page are generated by artist.js.
